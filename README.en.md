## What it is

OnePhoto (project name PhotoDelete) is a local-first iPhone photo cleaner. Review photos, videos, screenshots, albums, or a time and place. Queue what you do not want to keep, inspect the full pending list, then confirm before anything is written back to Photos.

Core cleanup is free. There is no account and no ad tracking. Photos stay on the device. A one-time supporter unlock adds similar-photo review, large-file cleanup, on-device compression, long-term stats, and achievements.

This is one small app from [One Apps Studio](https://oneapps.studio). Screenshots and product copy live at [oneapps.studio/apps/onephoto](https://oneapps.studio/apps/onephoto).

## Why it is open source

Since vibe coding took off, the same photo-cleaner has been rebuilt over and over. You do not need another empty project.

Fork this repo. Change the gestures, the review UI, or the cleanup queues. Open-source commercial use is free. Closed-source commercial use needs a license.

## Getting started

Requirements:

- Xcode 16.4+
- iOS 16.0+
- Simulator is fine for UI work. Use a real iPhone for Photos, iCloud Photos, limited library access, and real delete / favorite writes.

```bash
cd IOSAPP
open PhotoDelete.xcodeproj
```

Select a simulator or device, then press Cmd+R.

Build from the command line:

```bash
SIMULATOR_DESTINATION="$(scripts/resolve-ios-simulator-destination.sh)"
xcodebuild -project IOSAPP/PhotoDelete.xcodeproj -scheme PhotoDelete \
  -destination "$SIMULATOR_DESTINATION" \
  -derivedDataPath IOSAPP/DerivedData \
  clean build
```

Run tests:

```bash
SIMULATOR_DESTINATION="$(scripts/resolve-ios-simulator-destination.sh)"
xcodebuild test \
  -project IOSAPP/PhotoDelete.xcodeproj \
  -scheme PhotoDelete \
  -destination "$SIMULATOR_DESTINATION" \
  -derivedDataPath IOSAPP/DerivedData
```
